The market complex is spread over an area of 295 acres (1.19 km2). Inaugurated in 1996, the complex consists of about 3,100 shops,[1] including more than 1,000 wholesale shops and 2,000 retail shops.

The market has two blocks for vegetable shops and one each for fruit and flower shops. In Phase II, a textile market[4] and in Phase III, a food grain market[5] have been planned to be developed in the complex.
